# Operating Systems (COP 4600)

## Overview

Welcome to my **Operating Systems (COP 4600)** repository! This repository contains assignments that explore core concepts of operating systems, including process scheduling, concurrency, and multithreaded programming. Each assignment demonstrates practical applications of theoretical knowledge using Python and C.
